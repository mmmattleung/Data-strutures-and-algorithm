# Efficiency

## Introduction

Complexity is how well you're using your computer's resources to get a particular job done.It contains space and time.



## Quantifying efficiency

### Linear relationship

As the input increases, the number of lines executed increases by a proportional amount.

> As the input to an algorithm increases, the time required to run the algorithm may also increase.



The number of operations will be n^2*n*2. This is what we would call a **quadratic** rate of increase.

> As the input to an algorithm increases, the time required to run the algorithm may also increaseâ€”and different algorithms may increase at different rates.



### Order

> *The* *rate of increase* *of an algorithm is also referred to as the* ***order*** of the algorithm.



For example, instead of saying "this relationship has a linear rate of increase", we could instead say, "the *order* of this relationship is linear", and it marks as Big O.
