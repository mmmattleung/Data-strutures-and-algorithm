# Arrays and Linked Lists

## Collections

It's just a group of things. 

1. Don't have a particular order.
2. Don't need to have the same type of object.



## Lists

1. Have an order
2. Have no fixed length.



## Arrays

1. Have an index
2. Created with intial size
3. elements are all next to another in memory.



### The different between array and list:

1. index
2. memory position
3. fixed size



#### Python list

It's essentially like an array, like a dynamic array.



## Linked Lists

1. Have order but there are no indices
2. Store a next element as  a porperty of this element.
